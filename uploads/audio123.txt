hi good evening everyone today I am here to speak about artificial intelligence a branch of computer science that develops machines and software with human like intelligence artificial intelligence is ability of the computer program or machine to think and learn it is also a field of study which tries to make computer smart they work on their own without being encoded with commands with name artificial intelligence in 1955 in general use the term artificial intelligence means a machine which mimics human cognition at least some of things we associate with other Minds such as learning problem solving can be done by computers do not in the same way as we do address captain Michael handling define AI as a systems ability to correctly interrupt external data to learn from such data and to use those learning to achieve specific goals and start through flexible adaptation an ideal intelligent machine is a flexible agent which receives its environment and takes action to maximize its chance of success and machines become increasingly capable mental facility is one third to required intelligence are removed from the definition for example optical character recognition is no longer received as an example of artificial intelligence it is just a routine Technology at present we use the term AI for successfully understanding human speech contemplating at high level in strategy game systems self driving Cars interpreting Complex data some people also considered to humanity if it is continuous to progress at its current affairs and extreme rules is to create computer programs that can learn solve problem think logically in practice computer to better than people receiving its environment in any real sense is way beyond present a computer many different fields of Computer Science Mathematics linguistics and psychology neuroscience and philosophy event to create a General artificial intelligence which can solve many problems instead of focusing on just one researchers are also trying to create creative and emotional AI which can possibly and create are tools have been trying borrowing from the management literature
